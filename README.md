# LSTM-Text-Generation
Generating script of House M.D., a popular TV show using LSTMs.

The transcripts were obtained from live journal, an online platform, through Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Urllib. These were then merged into a single text file 'Final Merged UTF 2.txt'.

The code is based on the keras text generation example.

WARNING : Requires extreme computing power to train an LSTM NN.

Although a lot of problems still exist, this is my first attempt.

Thank you for your support!
